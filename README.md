"# Map_Naviation" 
This is a demonstration of Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest route in campus of NCKU.
It's rendered with OpenGl and we build the 3D models ourselves! Have Fun!
1. You can switch 2D/ 3D mode from the control panel on the left.

2. Use the mouse middle button to move the map and the left button th rotate the map in 3D mode.
3. Use the mouse right button to select the red dot on the map to select your start point and the destination and it'll show you the route!
